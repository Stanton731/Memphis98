<p>
I wasn't able to find any good looking, complete icon pack for actual KDE, that mimics look and feel of Windows 2000.<br>
So I decided to create one.<br>
<br>
This icon pack is based on icons found in GTK98, Chicago95 and GNUStep icon packs and on icons published at Alex Meub's Windows 98 Icon Viewer website.<br>
<br>
This is only an iconpack. If you want to enjoy full Windows 2000-like experience, I recommend to use this iconpack in combination with "MS Windows 9x" widget style and "Reactionary" Plasma shell theme.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!
